The board is filled with yellow tiles, each containing a letter. We need to go through each word on the board and check if the letter 'e' is present in any of them.\n\nNow, let's count the number of words that contain the letter 'e' in them. We will go through the board word by word and count the occurrences of 'e'.\n\n1. **Word 1**: \"E\" - This word contains the letter 'e'. Count: 1\n2. **Word 2**: \"A\" - This word contains the letter 'e'? No. Count: 0\n3. **Word 3**: \"B\" - This word contains the letter 'e'?

        "question": "what material should i load into the prusa i3 mk3 ?",
        "question_type": "hands-on",
        "gemini-2.5-flash": "To ensure optimal performance and longevity of your Prusa i3 MK3, it's important to use the correct materials for loading. The Prusa i3 MK3 is designed to work with a variety of materials, but the best choice depends on your specific project and the type of print you're doing. Here are some of the most common materials you can use:\n\n1. **PLA (Polylactic Acid)**: This is the most popular material for beginners and is known for its ease of use, low cost, and excellent print quality. PLA is also biodegradable and safe for the environment. It's great for prints that don't require high strength or durability.\n\n2. **ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)**: ABS is a more durable material than PLA and is often used for prints that require strength, such as model parts, mechanical components, and functional prototypes. It's also more expensive than PLA, but it can be used for high-temperature prints.\n\n3. **PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)**: PETG is a versatile material that combines the best features of PLA and ABS. It's strong, durable, and has a good print quality. It's also more resistant to warping than PLA, making it ideal for prints that need to be stable.\n\n4. **TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)**: TPU is a flexible material that's often used for prints that require flexibility, such as molds, rubber parts, and flexible prototypes. It's also more resistant to moisture than PLA and ABS.\n\n5. **TPE (Thermoplastic Elastomer)**: TPE is a flexible and durable material that's often used for prints that require flexibility and durability. It's also more resistant to warping than PLA and ABS.\n\nWhen choosing a material for your Prusa i3 MK3, consider the specific requirements of your project, such as the strength, flexibility, and durability needed. For most beginners, PLA is the best choice due to its ease of use and excellent print quality. However, if you need a more durable material, ABS or PETG may be better choices.",

Here are some general safety tips:\n\n1. **Use Proper Equipment**: Always use appropriate tools and equipment, such as gloves, safety goggles, and a sturdy carrying bag or container. This helps protect you from potential hazards like sharp edges, chemicals, or slippery surfaces.\n\n2. **Stay Aware of Your Surroundings**: Be mindful of your surroundings, especially when moving around the kitchen or any other area. Avoid distractions like loud noises or cluttered spaces, and ensure you have enough space to move safely.\n\n3. **Secure Your Load**: When carrying heavy items, make sure your load is properly secured. Use a backpack or a stable container to prevent the items from shifting or falling.\n\n4. **Check for Hazards**: Look for potential hazards like sharp objects, slippery surfaces, or electrical outlets. If you notice any, take precautions to avoid injury.\n\n5. **Use Proper Techniques**: When lifting or carrying items, use proper lifting techniques. Keep your back straight, engage your core, and avoid twisting your torso. This helps prevent back strain and injury.\n\n6. **Avoid Overloading**: Don't overload your carrying bag or container. Overloading can lead to instability and increase the risk of injury.\n\n7. **Stay Hydrated**: If you're carrying items that might be heavy or require a lot of effort, make sure to stay hydrated to avoid fatigue and potential mistakes.\n\n8. **Be Mindful of Weather Conditions**: If you're working outdoors or in a poorly ventilated area, be aware of weather conditions. Use appropriate clothing and protective gear to stay safe.\n\n9. **Follow Safety Instructions**: Always follow any safety instructions provided by the manufacturer or the environment you're working in.\n\n10. **Report Injuries**: If you experience any injuries, report them immediately to your supervisor or safety officer. This helps ensure that the issue is addressed promptly and safely.\n\nBy following these safety precautions, you can minimize the risk of injury and ensure a safer environment for yourself and others.",
