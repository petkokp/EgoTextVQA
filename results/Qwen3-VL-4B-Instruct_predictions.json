If you're referring to the dishwasher, here\u2019s how you can use it:\n\n1. **Load the Dishwasher**: Place clean, dry dishes and utensils into the dishwasher racks. Make sure to place larger items like pots and pans on the bottom rack, and smaller items like glasses and cups on the top rack. Avoid overloading the dishwasher.\n\n2. **Add Detergent**: Pour the appropriate amount of dishwasher detergent into the detergent compartment, usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher. If you're using a dishwasher that requires a rinse aid, add that as well.\n\n3. **Close the Door**: Ensure the dishwasher door is closed properly. The dishwasher will not operate if the door is not closed.\n\n4. **Start the Cycle**: Press the start button to begin the cycle. Most dishwashers have different cycle options, such as \"Normal,\" \"Heavy Duty,\" or \"Quick Wash.\" Choose the appropriate cycle based on the level of dirtiness of your dishes.\n\n5. **Wait for Completion**: Allow the dishwasher to complete its cycle. Once it\u2019s finished, open the door and remove the clean dishes.\n\nIf you meant something else by \"Home Spot,\" please clarify, and I\u2019ll be happy to help further!",

In most electrophoresis setups, the gel is run with an electric current, and the fragments migrate through the gel based on their size. The separation is usually indicated by the position of the bands or the distance traveled by the fragments from the well where they were loaded.\n\nIn many gel documentation systems, a pointer or arrow might be placed on the gel image to indicate the direction of migration or the location of the separation. However, without a specific image or diagram, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact pointer. If you have a diagram or image of the electrophoresis gel equipment, please provide it for a more accurate answer.\n\nIn general, the pointer indicating the separation is often labeled as \"separation\" or \"migration distance\" and is usually located near the gel image or on the gel documentation software interface.",

Check for proper maintenance and lubrication.\n\n3. **Check Load Capacity**: Never exceed the crane\u2019s maximum load capacity. Use a load chart to determine safe lifting limits.\n\n4. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the work area is clear of obstacles and people. Establish a safe zone around the crane\u2019s operating area.\n\n5. **Use Proper Lifting Techniques**: Use a crane to lift heavy or awkwardly shaped objects. Avoid overreaching or forcing the crane to lift beyond its capabilities.\n\n6. **Follow Operating Procedures**: Adhere to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines and any site-specific safety protocols.\n\n7. **Maintain Communication**: Use radios or hand signals to communicate with crew members. Ensure everyone is aware of the crane\u2019s movements.\n\n8. **Avoid Overloading**: Don\u2019t overload the crane or its attachments. Use appropriate slings or lifting gear.\n\n9. **Check Weather Conditions**: Avoid operating the crane in high winds, rain, or poor visibility conditions.\n\n10. **Stop Immediately if Something Goes Wrong**: If you notice any mechanical issues, unusual noises, or signs of instability, stop the crane immediately and report the issue.\n\nIf you meant something else by \"crane\" (e.g., a camera crane or a different context), please clarify, and I can provide more specific guidance.",

        "question_type": "intention reasoning",
        "gemini-2.5-flash": "Following the Tesla van safely depends on several factors, including the road conditions, traffic, and your vehicle\u2019s capabilities. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Maintain a Safe Distance**: Keep a safe following distance from the Tesla van. A good rule of thumb is to maintain at least 3 to 4 seconds of following distance under normal conditions. If the road is wet, in heavy traffic, or if the van is making sudden maneuvers, increase this distance.\n\n2. **Observe the Van\u2019s Behavior**: Tesla vehicles are equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), such as Autopilot, which can help with lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, and automatic braking. However, these systems are not foolproof and require the driver to remain attentive. Watch for any sudden movements or changes in the van\u2019s behavior.\n\n3. **Check for Road Signs and Signals**: Be aware of road signs, traffic signals, and any potential hazards. The Tesla van may be following a route that is not immediately obvious, so stay alert and be prepared to adjust your speed or lane position.\n\n4. **Avoid Distractions**: Keep your focus on the road and avoid distractions such as using your phone or adjusting the radio. This will help you react quickly to any unexpected situations.\n\n5. **Be Prepared for Emergencies**: If the Tesla van suddenly stops or makes an unexpected maneuver, be prepared to brake or steer to avoid a collision. Always keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.\n\nIn summary, while the Tesla van may be a reliable and advanced vehicle, it is important to follow safe driving practices and remain attentive to the road conditions and other vehicles.",
